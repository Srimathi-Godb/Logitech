Resizable_Circle Sample - Task acheived by using simple html,javascript,jquery and css codes.
Here we created smallest circle with 24*24 px size.
Circle size will get increased till reaching viewport size.
Once reached the max size, then if you clicked again the circle will get small in size.
We can directly download this file and we can open in chrome , no need any specific configuration to run this file becoz it is a simple html file.
We can directly run on browser.

Thanks!!!!!!!.
